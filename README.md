## üìç About
(DISCONTINUED)
KickAss is a multittool written in python that i made because i was inspired by [Astri](https://github.com/astros3x/Astri) and i wanted to make a tool like that, i had the links i needed, i just had to start coding, i didn't know where to start but 2loop and CaptainBeluga helped me out if i had issues. Now its an actual working program that has **40 different options**.

## üíª Usage
* Download the .exe from the latest [release](https://github.com/madhead341/kickass/releases/).
* You don't have to check versions because i made an auto-update with the latest release version.
* (The program could be detected as malicious because it's encrypted it in a certain way, if this happens you should disable your antivirus and turn it back on when you exit the program).
